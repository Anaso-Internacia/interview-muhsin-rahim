## Code 
- `node_modules` was committed.
- What is `/api/placeholder/300/445`?
- Good use of Tailwind.
- Would like to have seen the title cards on the search screen broken into a separate component.
- API key is hard-coded into the URL.
- Highly detailed comments inside of components should have been separate hooks or components (code comments != documentation).
- Easy to follow code with only a few formatting issues.
- Would like to have seen a typed language used, like TypeScript.
- README instructions are easy to follow, though poorly formatted.

## Site
- Movie search is nearly instant
- Features list says "Responsive dark theme UI", but the UI doesn't switch to light theme when I change my browser settings.
- Doesn't appear to be a way to get back to home screen after clicking on a title.
- Responds well to screen resizing.
- The IMDB link is a nice touch.
- Clean, minimalist style.
- Keyboard-only will only allow going to IMDB. No `<a>` tags to details page.
